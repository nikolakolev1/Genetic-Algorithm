v4 to v5
- tackle premature convergence
	- similarity based decisions
		- similarity matrix and array in the GA class
		- average population similarity method in the GA class
		- similarity between cities matrix inside the tspProblem class
			- a number between 0 and 1 where 1 is the same city
			- currently (as of 21.03.24) everything except for the actual coty is 0.
			  Adjusting that to give some similarity to close by cities would produce
				a more accurate similarity calculation in the GA class

v5 to v6
- change methods from static to normal
	- try introducing concurrency with multiple GA objects running in parallel
